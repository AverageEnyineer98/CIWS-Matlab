# CIWS-Matlab
#This project was inspired by the famous NAVAL weapon CIWS (Close in weapon system)
The weapon basically tracks whatever is coming with its built in radar, and shoot down if commanded.

The approach I took is by using two motors that control the yaw and the tilt angle, so basically it can point to anything above its base. This project will follow the real CIWS which has only 2 DOF

I decided to strap a camera on the arm so the camera will be the end effector
